# PA2lib
Programmer's arsenal 2 (continuation of PALib and based on Nightfox's lib)
<h2> why?<h2>
Nightfox's lib for libnds isn't updated anymore.
thus it can be incompatible with recent versions of libnds/devkitarm
  <h2> Why is called PA2lib </h3>
  PAlib is old, it was last updated on 2008, and it doesn't work with the latest version of
  libnds/devkitarm. Nightfox's lib is difficult but once you get it, you will be an expert of nintendo ds programming.
  So i decided to make nightfox's lib way easier
  
  <h2>nice, but how do i install it?</h2>
  installation requieres modifing the modifing the makefile and compile the lib.
  Compile the lib (double click makelib.bat) and then drag and drop the Include and lib folder
