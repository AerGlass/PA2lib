# PA2lib
Programmer's arsenal 2 (continuation of PALib and based on Nightfox's lib)
<h2> why?</h2>
Nightfox's lib for libnds isn't updated anymore.
thus it can be incompatible with recent versions of libnds/devkitarm
  <h2> Why is called PA2lib </h2>
  PAlib is old, it was last updated on 2008, and it doesn't work with the latest version of
  libnds/devkitarm. Nightfox's lib is difficult but once you get it, you will be an expert of nintendo ds programming.
  So i decided to make nightfox's lib way easier
  
  <h2>nice, but how do i install it?</h2>
  installation requieres modifing the modifing the makefile and compile the lib.
  Compile the lib (double click makelib.bat) and then drag and drop the Include and lib folder
  it's nightfox's lib for libnds but more simple (instead of initiledbg is initbg)
<h2>Examples?</h2>
Not yet lol
<h2>Credits</h2>
<strong>thanks to knightfox 75 for nightfox's lib for libnds</strong>
Thanks to PipeWarp because of simpleNFL
<h2>how to compile? </h2>
download devkitpro (www.devkitpro.org/) </p>
next download the repository </p>
Here are 2 options, compile using the batch file, or with the cmd. <br>
double click the makelib.bat file and let it do its work, if it doesn't compile
then report it on github. <br>
Using the cmd (terminal) go to the directory that is PA2LIB is located, enter to the
pa2 folder, then type in "make clean" when it finishes, type "make" it will compile the lib.
