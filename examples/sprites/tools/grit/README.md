GRIT is a tool which converts your graphics into stuff that the nintendo ds/gba can use.<br>
You need to convert your graphics before you can actually display</p>

Usage:<br>
Put in your .bmp files (they need to be 256 color or else it won't work, however i have configured grit in order for it to convert the images into 256 color.)</p>

for sprites click convert_sprites_autopal.bat<br>
for background click convert_backgrounds.bat</p>

if you converted backgrounds you should see a .map, .pal, .img files.<br>
if you converted sprites you should see a .pal and .img </p>

If you don't see anything convert your graphics again.<br>
If you don't see a .map/.pal/ then you image is not 8bit 256 color.
