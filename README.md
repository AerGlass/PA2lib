# PA2lib

This is not the main version, this is very unstable prerelease release of PA2lib Lion. <br>
This release is gonna be able to compile PAlib code, It will take and while, and for now it is not public, it is a mess. </p>
I'll problably release the source code if it works or if it gets less messy (or maybe if someone donates lol) but for now this is what i got. <br>
TODO LIST<br>
Recreate EACH PAlib print function.<br>
Recreate the PAlib renderer to make it work under PAGfx converted images.<br>
Push a default font into the binary (i have absolutely no idea on how to do this)<br>
profit.</p>

PAlib was a library made in 2007 that made libnds easy to use, unfortuonally this lib was badly designed and it not longer works.</p>
PA2lib is meant to replace PAlib, as this prerelease is able to compile some (with some work) simple PAlib code. Surely on the future it will work better!</p>
