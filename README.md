# PA2lib
Programmer's arsenal 2 (continuation of PALib and based on Nightfox's lib)</p>

a very small, simple but powerful library<br>
features:<br>
Very easy to learn <br>
text<br>
sprites<br>
backgrounds<br>
3D Sprites <br>
Sounds </p>
bad things:<br>
You NEED to use hbmenu to launch your game via r4!!!<br>
The library is in public beta prerelease, it is not stable<br>
Installation is somewhat complex. <br>
<h2> why?</h2>
Nightfox's lib for libnds isn't updated anymore.
thus it can be incompatible with recent versions of libnds/devkitarm
  <h2> Why is called PA2lib </h2>
  PAlib is old, it was last updated on 2008, and it doesn't work with the latest version of
  libnds/devkitarm. Nightfox's lib is difficult but once you get it, you will be an expert of nintendo ds programming.
  So i decided to make nightfox's lib way easier
  
  <h2>nice, but how do i install it?</h2>
  Use the template lol. <br>
  you also can compile the lib yourself, just double click the makelib.bat file
<h2>Examples?</h2>
Not yet lol
<h2>Credits</h2>
<strong>thanks to knightfox 75 for nightfox's lib for libnds</strong>
<h2>how to compile? </h2>
download devkitpro (www.devkitpro.org/) </p>
next download the repository </p>
Here are 2 options, compile using the batch file, or with the cmd. <br>
double click the makelib.bat file and let it do its work, if it doesn't compile
then report it on github. <br>
Using the cmd (terminal) go to the directory that is PA2LIB is located, enter to the
pa2 folder, then type in "make clean" when it finishes, type "make" it will compile the lib.
<h1>Docs?</h1>

<h1> license </h1> </p>
